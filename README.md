# backend

These are the two APIs we built. The first one is GraphQL API for medical and user storage. The second one is a secure endpoint API for enhanced privacy.

On the first file, you have access to all the GraphQL files for patient storage

On the second file, you have access to the full frontend for login, backend for authentication and our API.
